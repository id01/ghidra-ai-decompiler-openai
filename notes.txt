(Later version ideas)

First, we have the crawler API - runs AI on each decompiled function to name all the variables and add comments. Tries to guess the name and type of each global variable referenced as well.
The crawler API should make a guess on what structs and global variables are there.

Note: We need to be able to map the structs/global vars from the original decompiled name/address to the generated name for each function. <-- maybe we should curate a dataset manually with like 10k entries?

Next, we have the global var guesser API - synthesizes the global var guesses <-- this includes setting the data type(s) and name
Next, we have the struct guesser API - synthesizes the struct guesses <-- this includes setting the data type(s) and names
